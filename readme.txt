Shopping Basket Design.

MVP- The project has been created to allow for the following criteria to be met.

-Add items to a basket
-Remove items from a basket
-Empty basket

I am writing the project in Android Studio due to its support for Java, its preferable work flow and ease of test creation and use.

The project has been built from Scratch using TDD as the primary development tool. The code will be refactored and changed as required to create addition functionality.
